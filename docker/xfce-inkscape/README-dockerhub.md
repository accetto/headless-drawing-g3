***

This Docker Hub repository contains Docker images for headless working with the free open-source vector drawing application [Inkscape][inkscape].

The images are based on [Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (Noble Numbat)][docker-ubuntu] and include [Xfce][xfce] desktop, [TigerVNC][tigervnc] server and [noVNC][novnc] client.
The popular web browsers [Chromium][chromium] and [Firefox][firefox] are also included.

This [User guide][this-user-guide] describes the images and how to use them.

The related [GitHub project][this-github] contains image generators that image users generally donâ€™t need, unless they want to build the images themselves.

### Tags

The following image tags are regularly built and published on Docker Hub:

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD052 -->

- `latest` implements VNC and noVNC

    ![badge_latest_created][badge_latest_created]
    [![badge_latest_version-sticker][badge_latest_version-sticker]][link_latest_version-sticker-verbose]

- `chromium` adds Chromium Browser

    ![badge_chromium_created][badge_chromium_created]
    [![badge_chromium_version-sticker][badge_chromium_version-sticker]][link_chromium_version-sticker-verbose]

- `firefox` adds Firefox

    ![badge_firefox_created][badge_firefox_created]

**Hint:** Clicking the version sticker badge reveals more information about the particular build.

### Remarks

The images contain the current Chromium Browser from the `Ubuntu 18.04 LTS` distribution.
This is because the versions for `Ubuntu 24.04 LTS` depend on `snap`, which is currently not supported in Docker containers.

The [Chromium Browser][chromium] in these images runs in the `--no-sandbox` mode.
You should be aware of the implications.

The [Firefox][firefox] browser included in the images is the current non-snap version from the Mozilla Team PPA.
It's because the `Ubuntu 24.04 LTS` distribution contains only the `snap` version and the `snap` is currently not supported in Docker containers.

This is the **third generation** (G3) of my headless images.
The **second generation** (G2) contains the GitHub repository [accetto/xubuntu-vnc-novnc][accetto-github-xubuntu-vnc-novnc].
The **first generation** (G1) contains the GitHub repository [accetto/ubuntu-vnc-xfce][accetto-github-ubuntu-vnc-xfce].
