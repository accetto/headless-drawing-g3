### This files configures the environment (including secrets!) for building images locally.
### Source this file before building.
### Rename it to "secrets.rc" (or similar) and **make sure** that the '.gitignore' and '.dockerignore' files 
### contain the 'secret*' exclusion pattern! You do not need this file on Docker Hub! There you have
### to configure only some of these environment variables (see the comments). 
### Example: source ./secrets.rc
### This file is also automatically sourced by the 'hooks/env.rc' script.

### recommended also on Docker Hub
export DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1

### optional on Docker Hub
# export VERSION_STICKER_PREFIX="LOCAL-BETA-"

### optional on Docker Hub
### will force re-building regardless of verbose version sticker changes
# export FORCE_BUILDING=0

### optional on Docker Hub
### will prohibit re-building regardless of verbose version sticker changes
### useful for testing the autobuilding on Docker Hub before release
# export PROHIBIT_BUILDING=0

### optional on Docker Hub
### will force README re-publishing regardless of verbose version sticker changes
# export FORCE_README_PUBLISHING=0

### optional on Docker Hub
### will prohibit calling the post-push workflow and publishing the readme
### useful for testing on Docker Hub or by building from non-master branches
### ATTENTION: Docker Hub removed aut-building from free plans since 2021-07-26, so prohibit
### the post-push workflow execution and publish the readme using the provided utility
export PROHIBIT_README_PUBLISHING=1

### optional on Docker Hub
### GitHub repo and branch containing the post_push workflow to trigger
export POST_PUSH_WORKFLOW_REPO="headless-drawing-g3"
export POST_PUSH_WORKFLOW_BRANCH="master"

### required on Docker Hub
### these are not real secrets because they are revealed in the badge links in readme files
### builder and deployment gists could be also identical
### builder gist (@@headless-drawing-g3-builder)
export GIST_ID="xxxxxx"
### deployment gist (@@headless-drawing-g3-deployment)
export DEPLOY_GIST_ID="xxxxxx"
