## Introduction

The **Docker Hub** has removed the **auto-building feature** from the free plan since 2021-07-26.

This page describes how to build the images locally and optionally also push them to the **Docker Hub**.

The **second version** (G3v2) of the building pipeline makes it really easy, even if you want to build a set of images or all of them at once.

## Preparation

Open a terminal windows and change the current directory to the root of the project (where the license file is).

Make a copy of the secrets example file, modify it and then source it in the terminal:

```bash
### make a copy and then modify it
cp docker/src/examples/example-secrets.rc secrets.rc

### source the secrets
source ./secrets.rc

### or also

. ./secrets.rc
```

**TIP**: If you copy a file named `secrets.rc` into the folder `docker/hooks/`, then it will be automatically sourced by the hook script `env.rc`.

## Building pipeline

The actual building pipeline consists of the following hook scripts stored in the folder `docker/hooks`:

- `pre_build`
- `build`
- `push`
- `post_push`

The hook scripts are executed exactly in that order.

The **second version** (G3v2) of the pipeline has added also the helper script `cache`, which ist stored in the same folder. It is used by the hook scripts `pre_build` and `build` and it refreshes the local `g3-cache`. It can be also executed  stand-alone.

Utilizing the local `g3-cache` brings a significant boost in the building performance and much shorter building times.

There is also the helper script `util-readme.sh`, stored in the folder `utils/`. This script can be used for preparing the `README` file for the **Docker Hub**.

## Three ways of building images

Since the **second version** (G3v2) of the building pipeline there are the following ways of building the images:

- Building sets of images by executing the helper script `ci-builder.sh`
- Building the individual images by executing the helper script `builder.sh`
- Building the individual images by executing the hook scripts step-by-step

**Remark**: You can force the building of a new persistent image in any case by setting the environment variable `FORCE_BUILDING=1`.

### Building and publishing sets of images

Building and publishing of sets of images is pretty easy. Let's say that we want to refresh the images that feature the `Blender`. We can do that by executing the following command:

```shell
### PWD = project's root directory
./ci-builder.sh all group blender blender-chromium blender-firefox

### or also
./ci-builder.sh all group complete-blender

### or skipping the publishing to the Docker Hub
./ci-builder.sh all-no-push group complete-blender
```

The script `ci-builder.sh` is using the utility script `builder.sh` internally.

You can find more information and examples in the separate `readme` file, describing the utility `ci-builder.sh`.

**Remark**: The set can contain also a single image.

### Building and publishing individual images

Building and publishing of individual images is also very easy. Let's say we wan to refresh the image `accetto/ubuntu-vnc-xfce-opengl-g3:latest`. We could execute the following command:

```shell
### PWD = project's root directory
./builder.sh latest all

### alternatively with additional Docker CLI options
./builder.sh latest all --no-cache

### or skipping the publishing to the Docker Hub
./builder.sh latest all-no-push
```

The script `builder.sh` is using the individual hook scripts internally.

You can find more information and examples in the separate `readme` file, describing the utility `builder.sh`.

### Step-by-step building and publishing

The building pipeline can executed also step-by-step. The hook scripts in the folder `docker/hooks/` can be executed directly or also by using the utility script `builder.sh`.

The script `builder.sh` is using the individual hook scripts internally.

#### Step 1: `pre_build`

```bash
### PWD = project's root directory

./builder.sh latest pre_build
### or
./docker/hooks/pre_build dev latest

### alternatively with additional Docker CLI options
./builder.sh latest pre_build --no-cache
### or
./docker/hooks/pre_build dev latest --no-cache
```

This step builds the temporary helper image and creates the following temporary helper files that are used by other scripts:

- `scrap-version_sticker_current.tmp`
- `scrap-version_sticker-verbose_current.tmp`
- `scrap-version_sticker-verbose_previous.tmp`
- `scrap-demand-stop-building`

The file `scrap-demand-stop-building` is created only if the verbose version sticker hasn't changed since the last time it has been published on the builder repository's **GitHub Gist** and if the environment variable `FORCE_BUILDING` is not set to `1`. **Its presence will block** the next hook script `build` from building a new persistent image. If you want to force the image building, you can delete this file manually.

The other option is to set the environment variable `FORCE_BUILDING=1` **before** executing the `pre_build` script.

**Remark**: The temporary helper image is automatically removed by the script.

#### Step 2: `build`

```bash
### PWD = project's root directory

./builder.sh latest build
### or
./docker/hooks/build dev latest

### alternatively with additional Docker CLI options
./builder.sh latest build --no-cache
### or
./docker/hooks/build dev latest --no-cache
```

This step builds a new persistent image, named by default according the variable `BUILDER_REPO` (e.g. `headless-ubuntu-drawing-g3`).

**Remark**: Ensure that the file `scrap-demand-stop-building` is not present or the environment variable is set `FORCE_BUILDING=1`.

#### Step 3: `push`

```bash
### PWD = project's root directory

./builder.sh latest push
### or
./docker/hooks/push dev latest
```

This step creates the deployment image tag and pushes it to the deployment repository on the **Docker Hub**.

#### Step 4: `post_push`

```bash
### PWD = project's root directory

./builder.sh latest post_push
### or
./docker/hooks/post_push dev latest
```

This step updates the **GitHub Gists** belonging to the **builder repository** and the **deployment repository** and removes the temporary helper files created by the hook script `pre_build`.

### README files for Docker Hub

Each **deployment repository** has its own `README` file for the **Docker Hub**.

The source `README` file for the **Docker Hub** is split into two parts.

The first part is called `README-dockerhub.md` and it is the actual content of the `README` file for the `Docker Hub`.

The second part is called `readme-append.template` and it contains the templates for the badge links.

The final `README` file for the **Docker Hub** can be produced by the utility script `util-readme.sh`, which is stored in the `utils/` folder.

The result file will be named `scrap-readme.md` and its content can be copy-and-pasted manually to the **README area** of the repository on the **Docker Hub**.

The utility will also check the length of the result file, because it is limited to max. 25000 characters by the **Docker Hub**.

Therefore there is always also the full-length `README` file version, which is published only on the **GitHub**.

For example, the `README` file for the repository `accetto/ubuntu-vnc-xfce-opengl-g3` can be generated by the following command:

```bash
### PWD = utils/
./util-readme.sh --repo accetto/ubuntu-vnc-xfce-opengl-g3 --context=../docker/xfce --gist <deployment-gist-ID> -- preview

### or if the environment variable 'DEPLOY_GIST_ID' has been set
./util-readme.sh --repo accetto/ubuntu-vnc-xfce-opengl-g3 --context=../docker/xfce -- preview
```
