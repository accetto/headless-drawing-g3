## Introduction

The custom `g3-cache` has been introduced in the **second version** (G3v2) of the project.

The local `g3-cache` is an additional cache used by the building pipeline and it should not be confused with the **Docker builder cache** maintained by the [Docker Build][docker-doc-docker-build] itself.

The `g3-cache` stores the selected pre-downloaded packages used by the Dockerfiles, that would be otherwise repeatedly downloaded from the external sources by each build.

It results in a significantly higher performance by building sets of images or by repeated builds.

You can learn more about the concept on the sibling Wiki page ["Concepts of `g3-cache`"][sibling-wiki-concepts-of-g3-cache] and about the implementation on the sibling Wiki page ["How `g3-cache` works"][sibling-wiki-how-g3-cache-works].

### Ensure `wget` utility

If you are on Windows, you can encounter the problem of missing `wget` utility.
It is used by refreshing the `g3-cache` and it's available on Linux by default.

On Windows you have generally two choices.
You can build your images inside the `WSL` environment or you can download the `wget.exe` application for Windows.
Make sure to update also the `PATH` environment variable appropriately.

Since the version `25.04` the availability of the utility is checked.

The checking can be skipped by setting the environment variable `IGNORE_MISSING_WGET=1`.

The selected packages still will be downloaded into a temporary image layer, but not into the project's
`.g3-cache` folder nor the shared one, defined by the variable `SHARED_G3_CACHE_PATH`.

## Local `g3-cache`

The local `g3-cache` of this project has the following **cache sections**:

- `chromium`
- `drawio`
- `novnc`
- `tigervnc`
- `virtualgl`
- `websockify`

The local `g3-cache` folder `docker/.g3-cache` is excluded from the commits into the `git` repository by the means of the `.gitignore` file.

You can delete the local `g3-cache` folder any time, because it will be re-created each time you build an image.

## Shared g3-cache

The absolute path to the root folder of the shared `g3-cache` should be set as the value of the environment variable `SHARED_G3_CACHE_PATH`.

The same shared `g3-cache` is usually used also by the sibling projects, for example [accetto/debian-vnc-xfce-g3][accetto-github-debian-vnc-xfce-g3], [accetto/ubuntu-vnc-xfce-g3][accetto-github-ubuntu-vnc-xfce-g3] and [accetto/headless-coding-g3][accetto-github-headless-coding-g3].

## Helper script `cache`

Both `g3-caches` are refreshed by the helper script `cache`, which is stored in the folder `docker/hooks/`.
Therefore it's sometimes referenced as a hook script.

The script is used by the hook scripts `pre_build` and `build`.
However, it can be executed also stand-alone.

**Remark**: The current implementation of the cache refreshing code is not thread safe and it is not intended for parallel building of multiple images.
